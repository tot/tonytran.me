# About Time

Nearly two years ago, I had the idea of starting a blog. During the COVID-19 pandemic era, I wanted to share my experiences freelancing within the sneaker botting industry. Unfortunately, time wasn't on my side since the responsibilities of a junior high school student enveloped me.

However, now that I'm in my first semester of sophomore year of college, I have a bit more free time to explore writing and documenting my thoughts.

# Framework

I chose to build with Next.js 13's App Router because of the benefits of page layouts and React server components. Although many people have their qualms with the App Router, I believe it's better to adopt it now rather than further down the line where I'd have to do more work switching from the anitiquated Pages Router.

In addition to Next.js, I considered using [Astro](https://astro.build) because its island architecture paradigm loaded pages quicker than Next.js and was good for static pages. However, I kept with Next.js because of the larger ecosystem, which offers more development support and long-term stability. In the future, I'll revisit this issue and most likely switch if Next.js proves to be less performant than Astro.

# Content Management System

Like many people on [r/webdev](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/search/?q=headless%20cms), I initially fell into the rabbit-hole of searching for a headless content management system. I wanted a solution with little overhead and friction for writing and publishing articles. I tried a range of providers like [Payload](https://payloadcms.com/), [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/), and [Prismic](https://prismic.io/). However, these had downsides like service costs, customizability, and developer experience.

## Keep It Simple, Stupid!

After hours down the drain, I remembered the timeless saying, _"Keep it simple, stupid!"_. I drowned in all these trendy tools that I missed the most simple yet efficient solution for my use case: local markdown files. With Next.js, I could setup a Markdown blog easily and quickly with little overhead. Plus, with the addition of MDX, I could integrate React components with my Markdown files.

## Building Pages

To load my markdown files, I leveraged [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev/), a processor that transforms content into type-safe JSON sources. In the scope of this blog, Contentlayer processes the local MDX files into typed JSON files. The benefits of using Contentlayer for a blog is that it ensures consistency for my content. Even though Contentlayer is a relatively new product, I'm a firm believer in [T3's Axioms](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app):

1. Bleed Responsibly
2. Typesafety Isn't Optional

For me, Contentlayer satisfies both of these axioms and provides an extra level of comfort for the developer experience.

## Serverless Complications

My initial attempts of adding articles were short-sighted since I didn't realize the constraints of serverless architecture. I set up the blog using Contentlayer's remote sources, pulling articles from a private GitHub repository. I chose to do this because I could archive articles or keep in-progress articles private until they were ready.

To achieve this, I needed to create a script that went something like this to copy the repository's articles and build the pages:

```javascript title="contentlayer.config.ts" caption="Sync GitHub content using Node's fs module"
const syncContentFromGit = async(contentDir: string) => {
   const syncRun = async () => {
      const gitUrl = `https://${process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/${process.env.GITHUB_USER}/${process.env.REPO_NAME}.git`
      const isDirExists = await exists("blog-posts")

      try {
         if (isDirExists) {
            await runBashCommand(`cd "${contentDir}" && git pull`)
         } else {
            await runBashCommand(
               `git clone --depth 1 --single-branch ${gitUrl} ${contentDir}`
            )
         }
      } catch (e) {
         console.error(e)
      }
   }
// ...
}
```

Since I was using GitHub as a remote file source, I needed to clone the repository on the first installation of the blog and then continuously poll `git pull{:bash}` to keep the posts updated. However, on Vercel, I don't have access to run clone another repository within this repository. Moreover, this process complicated writing and maintaining the blog, especially since remote sources was an experimental feature in Contentlayer (ðŸ˜“).

As a result, I settled for the simpler solution, which was to just include the markdown files along with the repository. Now, the blog articles are directly with the Next.js App like this:

```plaintext caption="Structure of blog articles with Next.js App"
.
â”œâ”€â”€ posts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ archived/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ old-post.mdx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ published/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ public-post.mdx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ wip/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ still-writing.mdx
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â””â”€â”€ app/
        â””â”€â”€ website files
```

## MDX Caveats

As much as I love MDX for the providing the ability to embed JSX components into Markdown files, I ran into complications that stemmed from every component being wrapped in my `<p {...props}>{children}</p>{:typescript}` component. Although this wasn't a huge issue, it became annoying since styles were occasionally overwritten. To address this, I added CSS rules that targeted specific nesting patterns:

```css title="globals.css"
/* ... */

.mdx-blockquote div {
   @apply !m-0;
}

.footnotes #footnote-label {
   @apply text-lg font-semibold text-neutral-100;
}

.footnotes li div {
   @apply inline-block;
}

/* ... */
```

# Recap

All in all, it was fun building this blog and learning how to use MDX, Markdown, and the Next.js App Router. The blog isn't at its final state yet as there are still many improvements to make, but I'm excited to say that the first iteration is complete.
